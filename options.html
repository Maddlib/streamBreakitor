Append or Replace:
<select id="style">
 <option value="Append">Append</option>
 <option value="Replace">Replace</option>
</select>
<br>
<br>Append adds the unstreamed String to the end of the page. This does not go away without loading a new page/refreshing the current page. 
Navigating to a new tab in SPOC, including by searching for a new result, WILL NOT CLEAR the string.
<br>
<br>Replace breaks pages by removing what was there and replacing the entire page with a new string. This is great for monitor, because the pages
are essentially stand alone, but very much breaks SPOC functionality.
